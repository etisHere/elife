-Add a death count

-Make number emans life span shorter 

-Make a way for character emans to fight off the number emans so they don't all get eaten

-Make groups larger and last longer to make more of a flow instead of it looking like them scattered everywhere

-Make Captial letters into a new eman form that only eats numbers

-Make a symbol eman that eats all life forms but only can dupe once and once every 3 times it eats.
